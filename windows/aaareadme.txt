imp32.zip contains a compressed archive of an IMP77 compiler environment.

This environment depends on a version of Visual Studio (currently 2019)
which has a DOS shell installed for i86_64 32-bit code development.

Start up the DOS shell to gain access to the Windows C compiler and linker.

Inside that DOS shell:
1) move to the install location of the uncompressed archive.
2) run setenv to gain access to the IMP77 32-bit compiler.

The aaareadme.txt inside the top level folder of imp32 has more details on running the compiler.
The source\examples folder has some example programs and examples0..4.text files which
describe how to extend the IMP runtime library and even extend the IMP grammar.
